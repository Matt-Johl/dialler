# Standalone PBX for real phones (Ubuntu)

The Docker harness's Asterisk sits behind Docker Desktop's UDP port proxy,
which does not carry two-way RTP for a phone on the LAN (the same fault
that silenced the iPhone against the containerised server), and Homebrew
no longer ships Asterisk for the Mac. For a physical SIP phone, the PBX is
a stock Ubuntu Asterisk on another machine on the LAN, configured from
the files in this directory:

```sh
# on the Mac
scp -r harness/asterisk-native ubuntu-box:~/
ssh ubuntu-box 'sudo DIALLER_HOST=<this Mac's LAN address> sh asterisk-native/install-ubuntu.sh'

ASTERISK_HOST=<ubuntu-box address> make dev-server     # the light server, trunked to it
```

That gives a plain UDP trunk. For the encrypted one see **Secure trunk**
below — it needs certificates generated first, so it is not the default.

`install-ubuntu.sh` installs the `asterisk` package if needed, keeps the
package's original `/etc/asterisk` as `/etc/asterisk.dist`, renders
`pjsip.conf` with the light server's address, copies the other configs
in, opens the ports in ufw when it is active, and restarts Asterisk.
Re-run it after editing any `.conf` here.

Then in the app, dial `101` (the phone), `600` (PBX echo) or `echo`
(server echo); from the phone dial `201` (the app) or `600`.

## Phone configuration (Grandstream and similar)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| SIP server / registrar | the Ubuntu box's LAN address, port 5060 |
| Transport | UDP |
| SIP user ID / auth ID | 101 |
| Password | dialler101 (in `pjsip.conf`) |
| Codecs | PCMU, PCMA (G.711); disable others |
| NAT traversal / STUN | off (same LAN) |

`sudo asterisk -rvvv` on the Ubuntu box opens the console; `pjsip show
endpoints` lists 101 as Avail once the phone has registered, and the
`dialler` endpoint as Avail once `make dev-server` is up on the Mac (it is
qualified every 10 s).

## Registered lines instead of a trunk (SPEC §6 item 3c)

The same bench, with the light server registering the app's extension to
Asterisk as a third-party SIP device instead of trunking to it. The app is
unchanged: same enrolment, same welcome, and it never sees a PBX credential.

```sh
# on the Ubuntu box — lines mode needs no DIALLER_HOST (a line is reached at
# whatever its REGISTER advertised, not at a fixed address)
ssh ubuntu-box 'sudo LINES=1 sh asterisk-native/install-ubuntu.sh'

# on the Mac
ASTERISK_HOST=<ubuntu-box address> PBX_MODE=lines make dev-server
```

`provision.sh` seeds dev-a (the app's device, user 201) with the credential
`pjsip-lines.conf` expects, so there is nothing to type. Confirm both ends:

```sh
# the Mac's log
#   "pbx mode: lines" … lines=1
#   "pbx line: registered" line=201 dn=201 realm=asterisk
ssh ubuntu-box "sudo asterisk -rx 'pjsip show contacts'"
#   201/sip:201@<mac>:5062;transport=udp   Avail
```

`Avail` means Asterisk's OPTIONS keep-alive on the line is being answered —
the registration is not just accepted but usable.

Then, on the phone and in the app:

| Try | Expect |
|---|---|
| phone 101 dials **201** | the app rings — through the wake if it is backgrounded or killed |
| app dials **101** | the phone rings, showing **201** as the caller (not "dialler") |
| app dials **600** | the PBX echo, as on the trunk |
| kill the app, phone dials 201 | still rings: the line is registered by the server, not the phone |
| `sudo asterisk -rvvv`, watch a call out | `PJSIP/201-…` in the dial plan, and a challenge the server answers |

That fourth row is the point of the whole design: the exchange's INVITE
arrives at a registration this server holds around the clock, so a suspended
app is reachable.

To prove the credential path rather than assume it, break it and watch both
ends refuse:

```sh
curl -sSk -X POST https://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/admin/devices/dev-a/pbx-line \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer harness' \
  -d '{"digest_user":"line201","secret":"wrong"}'
# server log: "pbx line: refused" once, and no retry storm
# an outbound call now fails; the Asterisk log says "Failed to authenticate"
# put the right secret back and the line registers again within a second
```

Going back to the trunk is the two commands at the top of this file
(`DIALLER_HOST=… sh install-ubuntu.sh`, then `make dev-server` without
`PBX_MODE`). Run one mode or the other, never both: Asterisk matches an
inbound request by source address before it looks at the From user, so a
trunk identify would swallow the calls a registered line places.

Lines mode here is plain UDP. A secure *line* needs a per-device certificate
on the exchange, which is a follow-on (SPEC §6 item 3d); `TRUNK_TLS` and
`TRUNK_SRTP` configure the trunk and are refused alongside `LINES=1`.

## Transfers

When the app transfers a PBX phone to another PBX extension (say 101 is
talking to the app and the app transfers it to 600), the light server hands
the transfer to Asterisk with a REFER on the trunk leg and drops out: the
audio then runs phone ↔ Asterisk ↔ 600 without the server. That needs
`allow_transfer=yes` on the `dialler` endpoint (pjsip's default, stated in
`pjsip.conf`) and the target reachable in the `from-dialler` context. If a
PBX refuses the REFER, the server completes the transfer itself as before,
which keeps it in the media path; on a CUCM trunk, enable REFER on the
trunk profile to get the offload.

## Secure trunk (TLS, and SDES on top)

By default the trunk is plain UDP, which is what most PBXs run. To test the
secure path (SPEC §6 items 3a/3b) — SIP over TLS with each side
authenticating the other against a private CA, and SDES media keys carried
inside it — generate a certificate set for the **real** addresses, copy it
over with the configs, and install with `TRUNK_TLS=1`:

```sh
# on the Mac. OUT=lan keeps these apart from the docker harness's set,
# whose SANs are compose addresses and which the containers still need.
OUT=lan DIALLER_IP=<mac-ip> ASTERISK_IP=<ubuntu-ip> sh harness/tls/gen_certs.sh
scp -r harness/asterisk-native harness/tls/lan ubuntu-box:~/
ssh ubuntu-box 'sudo TRUNK_TLS=1 TRUNK_SRTP=1 DIALLER_HOST=<mac-ip> sh asterisk-native/install-ubuntu.sh'

TRUNK_TLS=1 TRUNK_SRTP=sdes ASTERISK_HOST=<ubuntu-ip> make dev-server
```

The two `TRUNK_SRTP`s have to travel together. The installer's puts
`media_encryption=sdes` on the `dialler` endpoint; the server's makes it
offer RTP/SAVP. Either one without the other is refused with **488 Not
Acceptable Here** on every trunk call — the PBX rejecting an encrypted
offer it cannot answer, or a plain offer it is configured to refuse — and
that 488 looks identical to a broken SDP. The installer renders
`pjsip.conf` from the repo copy on every run, so a `media_encryption` line
added by hand on the box does not survive the next re-run; pass the flag
instead.

The SANs are the addresses each side is **dialled by**, so a set generated
for the wrong addresses verifies by hand and then fails every call; the
installer prints the SAN of what it is about to install for that reason.
Regenerate with `FORCE=1` after either machine changes address.

Asterisk then listens on **5061/tcp** with `require_client_cert=yes`, so it
will not even qualify the server without a valid certificate — `pjsip show
endpoints` showing `dialler` Avail is itself proof the mutual handshake
worked. Check the transport loaded with `asterisk -rx 'pjsip show transport
transport-tls'`; a missing certificate file leaves Asterisk running with no
TLS listener at all rather than failing loudly.

Without `TRUNK_SRTP=sdes` the media stays in the clear and the server says
so at startup (`trunk SRTP over unencrypted signalling` is the opposite
warning — SDES *without* TLS). The same pairing is asserted headlessly by
`make harness-trunk-secure`.

## Ports

Ubuntu box: 5060/udp (SIP), **5061/tcp only with `TRUNK_TLS=1`** (SIP over
TLS), 10000–10200/udp (RTP, `rtp.conf`).
Mac: 5061/tcp+tls and 7443/tls (light server, app side), **5062** (the
server's trunk listener — udp for a plain trunk, tcp/tls for a TLS one),
20000–20100/udp (server media relay).

5062 rather than the conventional 5061 for a TLS trunk: 5061 is the app
leg's port and two SIP listeners on one address cannot share it. The server
refuses a configuration where they collide rather than failing with a bare
"address in use". It costs one field on the PBX — `contact=sip:<mac>:5062`
in the `dialler` AOR here, *Destination Port* on a CUCM trunk — and nothing
at all outbound, where we dial the PBX's own 5060/5061. `-trunk-addr`
changes it if a deployment needs the trunk on 5061; the app leg would then
have to move (`-sip-addr` plus `-public-sip-port`), or the two legs be
given separate addresses.

## Refusing extensions that are not there

`extensions.conf` has a `dial-status` context that every dialling context
includes. It turns `Dial()`'s outcome into a SIP status — CHANUNAVAIL →
`Hangup(20)` → **480 Temporarily Unavailable**, BUSY → 17 → 486, CONGESTION
→ 34 → 503. Without it a failed `Dial` falls through to a bare `Hangup()`,
the PBX sends nothing that says why, and the caller is left on ring-back.

`pjsip.conf` pairs that with `qualify_frequency` + `remove_unavailable=yes`
on the phone AORs. A phone that is switched off never unregisters, so its
contact stays on file and `Dial()` rings it for the full 30 s; qualify is
what notices and removes it, and only then does `Dial` fail fast. Detection
costs up to `qualify_frequency + qualify_timeout` (30 s + 3 s here), so a
call placed in that window still rings — that is inherent, not a bug.

Both are exercised by `make harness-pbx-unavailable` against the docker
PBX, which carries the same config. Re-deploy after changing either:

    scp -r harness/asterisk-native ubuntu-box:~/
    ssh ubuntu-box 'cd asterisk-native && sudo DIALLER_HOST=<mac-ip> sh install-ubuntu.sh'
