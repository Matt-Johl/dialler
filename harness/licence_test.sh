# The product licence (SPEC §4.9) against the real server and the headless
# app: the dev licence installs, a bad paste is refused with its reason, a
# smaller licence suspends exactly the newest holders (refused at the
# gateway with "no licence seat", refused a fixture token with 409), and
# the restored licence lets them back in. Trunk mode, no PBX needed. The
# lines-mode half of seat loss (the PBX line dropped) is unit-tested in
# cmd/dialler-server and proven live by pbx_lines_test.sh's registrar.
# Exit 0 = pass.
