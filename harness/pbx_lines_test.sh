# Headless PBX **lines** mode (SPEC §6 item 3c): the light server registers
# one third-party SIP line per device to the PBX instead of being an
# IP-trusted trunk peer. Asterisk stands in for CUCM — it is the only
# exchange available — and what it can and cannot prove is written down in
# the SPEC item; the CUCM-only half is the §7.3 item 10 checklist.
#
#   register: both lines reach a registration the PBX will dial, and the
#         PBX's own OPTIONS keep-alive on them is answered.
#   in:   desk phone 100 dials 211 → Asterisk dials the registered line at
#         the contact our REGISTER advertised (rewrite_contact=no, so a
#         wrong contact fails here rather than being papered over) → app
#         211. Asserts the app recorded the desk phone's tone.
#   out:  app 211 dials 100 → the server's INVITE goes out as line 211 and
#         is CHALLENGED by Asterisk (auth= on the endpoint, as CUCM
#         challenges line-side INVITEs) → desk phone 100. Asserts the desk
#         phone recorded the tone AND that the call arrived as 211 rather
#         than as some shared identity.
#   badpass: one line's credential is replaced with a wrong one through the
#         admin API. That line must latch "refused" and stop — no retry
#         storm — while the other line stays registered and still calls.
