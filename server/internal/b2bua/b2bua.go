// Responsibilities:
//   - terminate the app leg over TLS (SPEC §4.4 rules 1-2);
//   - registrar for provisioned users, feeding the registry (diago handles
//     INVITE dialogs but not REGISTER, so this is ours);
//   - route inbound INVITEs: local + registered → bridge; local + not
//     registered → wake the device via the gateway, wait for it to register,
//     then bridge; unknown → 404; trunk → 503 until the PBX leg (Phase 2);
//   - bridge the two legs with media proxied through the server (rule 3).
