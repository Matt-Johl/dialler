// Everything here is inert unless a deployment turned that mode on. The one
// rule the whole feature rests on is that a call towards the PBX must
// present the *calling device's* number and answer challenges with that
// line's credential — an exchange rejects a From that is not the registered
// line, and would attribute the call to the wrong user if it did not.

// It must be called before Start: the registry is read from the call path
// without a lock, and Start is what begins serving calls. It is a setter
