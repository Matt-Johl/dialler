// Package pbxline keeps this server registered to a PBX as one third-party
// SIP device per app device (SPEC §6 item 3c).
//
// The server registers, never the app. A phone holding the PBX credential
// would be the registered endpoint, so the PBX would send its INVITE to a
// contact that stops existing the moment iOS suspends the app — the problem
// this product exists to solve (§2). So the lines here are held around the
// clock whatever the phones are doing, the INVITE always lands on a live
// element, and the wake path is untouched.
//
// This package owns the *timing and the state* of those registrations: when
// to refresh, how long to back off, when to give up. The SIP itself is
// behind the Registrar seam, as trunkQualifier's probe is (b2bua/qualify.go),
// so the machine that decides all of that is testable without a SIP stack.
